# ECS-130: Scientific Computation 
This includes all of the Linear Algebra and algorithmic projects that I have completed throughout the course of ECS 130. This course entailed me to a deep amount of algorithmic and mathematical procedures, such as the Cholesky factorization, Householder algorithms, and other unique linear systems. The course's emphasis on linear systems gave me a deep understanding of ML designs and different methods to approach optimization in a coding environment. 

# Course Overview 
ECS 130 is a comprehensive undergraduate-level course designed to introduce computer science majors to numerical computing and algorithmic design using MATLAB. The course focuses on matrix-vector approaches to solve problems in floating-point arithmetic, error analysis, data interpolation, optimization, matrix eigenvalues and singular values, and parallel computing for matrix operations. The aim is to provide a solid foundation in numerical methods, emphasizing their applications in computer science and computational work.

The course covers both theoretical aspects of numerical computing as well as practical implementation in MATLAB. It is especially beneficial for students pursuing computational careers, providing them with essential skills and tools that are used in a variety of fields, including machine learning, scientific computing, and data analysis.
